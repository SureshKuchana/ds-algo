// Memoization is a programming technique which attempts to increase a functionâ€™s performance by caching
// its previously computed results. 
// Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache.
// If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function.
// Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.
// Let's take an example of adding function with memoization

const memoizAddition = () => {
  let cache = {};

  return (value) => {
    if(value in cache){
      console.log('Fetching from cache');
      return cache[value]
    } else {
      console.log("calculating result");
      let result = value + 20;
      cache[value] = result;
      return result
    }
  }
}

// returned function from memoizAddition
const addition = memoizAddition();
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached
