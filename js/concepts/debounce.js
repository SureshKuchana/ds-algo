// Debounce (For improving the performance of events in javascript plugins)

// Debouncing and throttling are both used to enhance the website performance 
// by limiting the number of times the events are triggered.

// Debouncing and throttling are not provided by JavaScript.
// Theyâ€™re just concepts that can be implemented using the setTimeout web API.

/**
 * Debounce is a technique used to control the how many times function to 
 * be executed over time.
 *  (or)
 * Debounce function forces a function to wait a certain amount 
 * of time before running again.
 * 
 * (or)
 * With debouncing, you wait a specified amount of time before running a function.
 * The last attempt to run the function is the one that runs,
 * and any previous attempts within the time period are ignored.
