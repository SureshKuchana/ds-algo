// Throttle (For improving the performance of events in javascript plugins)

// Debouncing and throttling are both used to enhance the website performance 
// by limiting the number of times the events are triggered.

// Debouncing and throttling are not provided by JavaScript.
// Theyâ€™re just concepts that can be implemented using the setTimeout web API.

/**
 * Throttling is also used to rate-limit the function call. 
 * Throttling will fire the function call only once in 1000ms(the limit which we have provided),
 * no matter how many times the user fires the function call.
 * 
 * (or)
 * 
 * With throttling, you run a function immediately, and wait a specified amount of time before
 * running it again. Any additional attempts to run it before that time period is over are ignored.
